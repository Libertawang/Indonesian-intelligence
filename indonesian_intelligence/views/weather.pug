                    The main variable in Indonesia's climate is not the temperature or the 
                    air pressure. It is the rainfall that plays a crucial role. Since Indonesia
                    is split by the equator, it has an almost entirely tropical climate, with the 
                    coastal planes averaging 28Â°C. The only two seasons are Rainy season (December to March)
                    and Dry season(June to September).

                    p.
                        Bali attracts plenty of tourists every year 
                        through its wild beaches, its lush plains of luminous rice,
                        and its temples. Bali is a good destination any time of the 
                        year. There is more rainfall from November to March but the rains 
                        are usually followed by sunny clear skies.
                        That said, April to September is the best time to visit Bali when
                        there it is the sunniest making the time spent at the beaches swimming
                        and surfing the most fun!!

                        With its endless green rice paddies, 
                        rumbling volcanoes, fascinating culture 
                        and spiritual temples, Java is one of the 
                        most captivating islands in Indonesia. It is 
                        pretty dry and hot during the months April and 
                        October making it the best time to visit 
                        java for watching the sun rise over giant buddhas, 
                        rumbling Bromo (the Volcanos).

                    p.
                        Sumatra has a hot and humid tropical climate. The monsoons are 
                        extreme and lead to potholed and unpaved roads. It also makes 
                        hiking miserable during a downpour. Therefore, the best time to 
                        visit Sumatra is either May and June, or September and October, 
                        missing the peak (and hottest) summer months and the extreme 
                        monsoon months. Orangutans can be seen throughtout the year.

                    p.
                        The difference between the dry and wet seasons are slightly 
                        bigger in this region. This region lies to the east of Bali. As
                        a rule of thumb, the closer to Autralia you are, the longer the
                        dry season. Nusa is known for its tropical wonderland of dazzling 
                        white beaches, luminous turquoise seas, hidden villages and thrilling 
                        wildlife. Dry months are favourable for their sunshine and blue skies.
